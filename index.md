## About STEP 

In the Science through Technology Enhanced Play (PLAY) project, we are investigating how embodied play among elementary school students can be used to help them understand scientific phenomena (e.g., the working of forces, complex behaviors of bees).

This is a recent implementation of GEM-STEP in action:

This video illustrates using the STEP-BEES platform:

The STEP Project consists of a collection of grants including:

- **STEP**: Our initial foray into exploring how embodied play can support students in engaging with scientific concepts. We explored different kinds of play (modeling oriented sociodramatic play and more game-like play) as well as exploring two content areas–the particulate nature of matter, and honeybees collecting nectar.  Grant Abstract
- **PLAE**: In the Promoting Learning though Annotation of Embodiment project we added in the ability for other students to use an iPad app and annotate their peers’ activity.  Grant Abstract
- **iSTEP**: In the Interactive STEP project, we added in new forms of embodied engagement including pose tracking and props, so that we can explore their impact on students’ engagement with the activities, and the resulting learning.  Grant Abstract
- **GEM-STEP**: The Generealized Embodied Modelling STEP project aims to support learners of all ages in developing their own hybrid embodied models through a combination of scripting and play. 

Note that this work extends our prior work on the Learning Physics through Play (LPP) Project.
